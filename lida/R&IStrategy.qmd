That through Programmes and Communities, aims to define/ set/ address future research agenda.

Communities : Env that Phil Livermore leads. Meteorology, glaciology, Satellite Data

Programmes : 

* methods development activity in academia around DS & AI challenges – particularly AI/ML methods  
* Algorithm Transparency, Responsible AI etc.
* Data research infrastructures (cloud, data/AI platforms and pipelines, tools) and data visualisation

* Events : seminars, workshops and hackathons 
* Spillovers : cross-council grants etc.
* But really : set agenda, deep dives into new important datasets, methods dev that changing discipline

E&T important component. DSDP, CPD short courses, Data Science Programmes that LIDA supports.


DSDP : 

* ECR data scientists on 6-month, proof-of-concept research projects
* With partners : academics, private/public sector
* Quicker, leaner than appointing RAs.

Professional Services

LIDA provides expertise in data analytics to help colleagues from all faculties to advance knowledge through internationally outstanding research and education in interdisciplinary data science and artificial intelligence.

The Leeds Analytics Secure Environment for Research (LASER) is a cutting edge cloud based (Microsoft Azure) platform hosted in LIDA, designed to empower researchers and students to drive data analytics excellence at the University.

LIDA’s research environment – including both secure offices and LASER platform – securely hosts data that are highly sensitive, personally identifiable or commercially sensitive. This capability aids the development of research that can make a difference to our local communities and the world around us.

LIDA absolutely not meant to compete with, or detract from R&I that happens within schools.

Instead to support and enhance it. 

Generating excitement, new connections across UoL -- so that migth be able to "go for"
grants / other things that wouldn't normally consider ....


Selfish interest in more SEE collaboratiob, via Environment community
