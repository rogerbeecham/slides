80% SoG | 20% LIDA 

I do "applied data science" in Geography. 

And I'm going to talk about this -- and a couple of projects ongoing over the last year or so ...

If I were to give a primer on Open Science theory and practice in Geog.

Stats19 -- the road safety dataset for UK

Had some  draft pre-registration report/proposal looking at pedestrian injury -- 

* inequalities in who-hit-whom
* before / after analysis, establishing effect of intervention classes on crash rates/ injury sevrity.

Wanted to do this in a good, rigorous empirical way.

Open Science response to reprdoducibility crisis in empirical science diagnosed in 2010s

P-hacking and disreputable practices but also open-ended nature of analysis means that you end up making decisions that end up biaising your results downstreant that you are not aware of...

Structural changes / standards in how science is conducted, reported, and rewarded.

Aim to Establish empirical rigour, replicable and testable analysis  

BUT : 

Can lead to didactic and narrow set of practices 
may not apply well to applied analysis :

Explore > Pre-register > Test

This paper questions whether tenets of science reform necessarily lead to defensible science.

If exploratory analysis is limited and shallow, then can end up testing poorly specified null hypotheses.

We could definitely have done this -- and come up with some p-values...

But it was very clear to us that this would have not been a particularly sensible study -- there is loads of additional context that we were not accounting for, when reducing down to a single set of testable hypotheses. 

Analysing road crashes that are particular events that happen in context, is different to, say experimental research, where might establish the effect of statins on blood pressure.

**Demonstrating** how we do scientific exploration in a way that is:

* structured (that acknowledges important branching points and makes careful decisions on what to persue)
* that uses theory, heuristics -- and models -- to support interpretion 
* that uses statistical techniques de-emphasises / discourages spurious disovery.
* that considers *coverage* -- how likely are dominant effects likely to hold? how sensitive are they to noise?

This was a model-based analysis, but emphasis in models is different -- more on using models for helping us to identify parts of data space that is surprsing--
less interested in how much overall data depart from expectaiton, but *where* this is the case 


* that considers appropriate levels of data and analytic uncertainty -- some might be represented by statistical computation; others might be more epistemic; that considers 

And so instead we pushed our exploratory analysis in various directions, using combinations of models and data graphics in tandem -- in a way that geographers often do, but that you tend not to see in data analysis primers.

When doing **good** data-driven research we need to consider these two things at the same time.

Rigour :

-- established, well-justified and thoroughly considered analysis plans


Richness :

-- descriptive detail that underpins the inferences we make necessary for generalising / transfer
-- if context under which data / findings generated not properly detailed, should we be surprised about a replication crisis? 


We ask:

-- do the things/recipes we associate with rigour really lead to more defensible, better science?
-- straightjacket, risk getting trapped in local minima + mechanics of pre-registration
